# DiceRoller
# About the project
This is a mini project from Angela Yu's IOS development bootcamp that gives lets the user generate a random dice number on the touch of a button.But there is a twist. I have added two functions to animate the leftDiceView and rightDiceView such that they scroll through all the dice values before giving the user the final dice numbers thereby giving a good touch.
